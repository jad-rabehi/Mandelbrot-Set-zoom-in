# Mandelbrot set genaration with automated zooming in using Matlab
---
Mandelbrot set is a form fractal obtained by visualizing convergence of the complex function *f(z)=z^2+c* for different value of c in the complex plan.
 

## Result

This result is obtained for *c=x+iy* with *x in [-2,0.8]* and *y in [-1.4,1.4]*

Here, for choosing colors, we use the scalar color maps existing in matlab with:

'''
colormap jet
'''

we get
